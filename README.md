# CIFAR-10 Example
Dominant Color Predictor and Generative Art Project
This project explores the use of machine learning to analyze and visualize the dominant colors in images. Starting with the CIFAR-10 dataset, a custom neural network predicts the dominant color (Red, Green, or Blue) of each image based on pixel intensity.

Building on this foundation, the project ventures into generative art. By leveraging the predicted dominant color, it creates unique, color-themed artistic patterns, blending technology and creativity. The goal is to combine data-driven insights with visual expression, offering an interactive and artistic perspective on machine learning outputs.
