# CIFAR-10 Example

Dominant Channel Predictor and Generative Art
This project combines machine learning with generative art to analyze and visualize dominant colors in images. Using the CIFAR-10 dataset, a custom neural network predicts the dominant color channel (Red, Green, or Blue) based on pixel intensity.

Building on these predictions, the project generates unique, color-themed artistic patterns, blending technology and creativity. Recent efforts included integrating GPT-2 and Stable Diffusion APIs via Hugging Face to create visuals (and potentially stories) based on the detected dominant channel. While generating visuals works, story generation has limitations, and occasional queue delays impact processing.
